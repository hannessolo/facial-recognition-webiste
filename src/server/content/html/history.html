  Face recognition technology has always been viewed as something straight out of science fiction. Over the past decades, this ground-breaking technology has not just become viable, but it has also become widespread. In fact, it seems almost impossible nowadays to read technology news which do not deal with face recognition.
There are several industries which benefit from this technology. Crime and violence are being prevented by retailers. Face recognition is used by law enforcement agencies to keep communities safer. Airports are improving traveller’s convenience and security. Facial recognition is used particularly by mobile phone companies in order to provide consumers with new layers of biometric security.
It may seem to some people that facial recognition is very recent and that it came out of nowhere. In reality, this technology has been used for some time already.

<h4>MANUAL MEASUREMENTS BY BLEDSOE (1960S)</h4>
<p>
  According to some, the father of facial recognition was Woodrow Wilson Bledsoe. In the 1960s, he developed a system that could classify photos of faces by hand using what’s known as a RAND tablet. A RAND tablet was a device that could be used to input vertical and horizontal coordinates on a grid using a stylus that emitted electromagnetic pulses. This particular system was used to manually record the coordinate locations of several facial features, such as eyes, hairline, mouth and nose. These values could then be inserted in a database. After this, once the user gave the system a new picture of an individual, it was capable to get the image from the database that most resembled that profile. Unfortunately, at that time, the technology of the era and computer processing power severely limited facial recognition. However, it was certainly an important step in proving that facial recognition was a possible viable biometric.

<h4>INCREASED ACCURACY WITH 21 FACIAL MARKERS (1970S)</h4>
<p>
  During the 1970s, Harmon, Lesk and Goldstein found a way to add better accuracy to a manual facial recognition system. 21 specific subjective markers were used in order to identify faces automatically. These markers included lip thickness and hair color. As for Bledsoe’s system, the actual biometrics had to be computed manually.

<h4>EIGENFACES (LATE 1980S-EARLY 1990S)</h4>
<p>
  Sirovich and Kirby, in 1988, began applying linear algebra in order to solve the problem of facial recognition. Their method became known as the Eigenface approach. It started as a search for a low-dimensional representation of facial images. They found a way to show that feature analysis on a collection of facial images could form a set of basic features. Later on, in 1991, Turk and Pentland expanded upon the Eigenface approach by discovering how to detect faces within images. This led to the first instances of automatic face recognition.

<h4>SUPER BOWL XXXV (2002)</h4>
<p>
  At the 2002 Super Bowl, facial recognition was used by law enforcement officials in a major test of the technology. Unfortunately, the test was seen as a failure. False positives and backlash from critics proved that face recognition wasn’t quite ready for prime time. One of the most important limitations during that time was that face recognition did not yet work well in large crowds, functionality that is relevant when using face recognition for event security.

<h4>LAW ENFORCEMENT FORENSIC DATABASE (2009)</h4>
<p>
  The Pinellas County Sherriff’s Office created in 2009 a forensic database that allowed officers to tap into the photo archives of the state’s Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (DHSMV). Two years later, in 2011, 170 deputies had been allocated with cameras that let them take pictures of suspects that could be cross-checked against the database. Through this technology, more arrests and criminal investigations, which would have been impossible to obtain, were achieved.

<h4>SOCIAL MEDIA (2010)</h4>
<p>
  In 2010, social media, such as Facebook, began to implement facial recognition functionalities. These had the aim to identify people whose faces may be featured in the pictures that the social network users update daily.
</p>
<h4>NEURAL NETWORKS</h4>
<p>
  In the 2010s, <a href='/CNNs'>neural networks</a> were introduced as the new standard in machine learning, and therefore also facial recognition. Although the idea of neural networks has been around for much longer, it only became viable in the last decade, because of the large amount of computing power required, as well as the large amount of data required to train a neural network.

<h4>OSAMA BIN LADEN IDENTIFIED (2011)</h4>
<p>
  As mentioned before, law enforcement and military professionals used face recognition for forensics. In fact, it is recognised as the most effective way to positively identify dead bodies. As an example, the identity of Osama bin Laden was confirmed by facial recognition, after he was killed in a U.S. raid.
</p>
<h4>IPHONE X (2017)</h4>
<p>
  In 2017 the <a href='/iPhoneXCaseStudy'>iPhone X</a> was released. Apple advertised face recognition as one of its most important features, relevant in particular for device security. The new model sold out really fast, proving that nowadays consumers accept facial recognition as the new gold standard for security.
