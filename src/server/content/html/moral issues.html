<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Scientific literature on ethical and privacy implications of biometrics is
  becoming increasingly important. A sharp debate is emerging about whether
  biometric technology offers society any significant advantages over
  conventional forms of identification and whether it constitutes a threat to
  privacy and a potential weapon in the hands of authoritarian governments.</p>
<p>There are two interrelated issues about biometrics that are worth discussing
  in general terms. They are “function creep” and the so-called “informatization
  of the body”.</p>
<h4>Function Creep</h4>
<p>“Function creep” is the term used to describe the expansion of a process or
  system, where data collected for one specific purpose are subsequently used
  for another unintended or unauthorized purpose. Since 2001, function creep has
  been in the limelight of the ethical and privacy debate. Function creep
  represents a serious breach of the ethical tenet that requires a moral agent
  to be honest and responsible for her actions; from a political perspective
  function creep is a serious lesion of public trust and menaces to destroy
  confidence in biometric systems. Most problems connected with respect to
  privacy and data protection in biometric applications are actually rooted in
  the issue of function creep. Generally speaking, function creep refers to
  information that is collected for one purpose but being used for another.
  Consequently, in the context of biometric identification it should refer to
  any use of biometric data different from mere identification. Function creep
  in the field of automated personal recognition may be motivated by several
  reasons (from state intelligence to commercial purposes) and it is not limited
  to biometric identification. Most examples of function creep are indeed rather
  innocuous. The “Social Security Number” in the United States is an often cited
  example of function creep. Although the original social security cards bore
  the warning that the SSN could not be used for identification, in the 1960s
  the Internal Revenue Service started using the SSN for tax payer
  identification and today the SSN has been the main identity document used by
  most US citizens. Function creep usually involves three elements: (1) a policy
  vacuum; (2) an unsatisfied demand for a given function; and (3) a slippery
  slope effect, or a covert application. A policy vacuum is probably the most
  important element to determine the risk of function creep. When organizations
  adopt new information technologies, or new information schemes, failing to
  create specific policies, these technologies end up being driven only by the
  different interests of various stakeholders. As a result, the new scheme may
  develop in a quite different sense – sometimes even opposite – from that
  primarily intended. Civil liberties advocates have the tendency to implicitly
  blame people because they adopt new technologies without considering the
  downside. Yet it is evident that the main responsibility rests with policy
  makers who should create the opportune policy frame for innovations. An
  unsatisfied demand for a given function is the second important element that
  has the potential for creating a function creep. Information collected for one
  purpose is used for another when there is a need that is not properly met. In
  the example of the SSN, it is evident that the lack of a suitable tax payer
  identifier was the main driver for the SSN’s mission change. Finally, function
  creep must develop almost unnoticed. Usually, function creep happens for one
  of two reasons: either the new functions develop little by little, quite
  innocently, because of the incremental effect of several minor changes of
  mission/technology misuse, or the new functions are the result of a hidden
  agenda or of various undisclosed purposes. Warrantless cell phone tracking by
  law enforcement is a good example of this latter kind of function creep, which
  is obviously the most ethically and politically worrisome. Analyzing function
  creep more in depth, and in the context of biometric applications, one should
  distinguish between two different situations: the first being when biometric
  identification is used beyond the limits for which the system was officially
  adopted, the second being when biometric identification is used to generate
  extra information which is not per se relevant to identification. As per the
  first point, it is evident that any identification scheme can be carried out
  with a hidden agenda (e.g. sorting out some social groups, collecting extra
  information about people and eliciting the feeling of being under observation)
  and biometrics does not make an exception. For instance a security agency
  could decide to carry out a covert screening programmer parasitic to a
  standard identification/verification programmer. People enrolled for
  identification or verification purposes could also be covertly screened
  against, say, a database of terrorists. In such a case, biometrics would still
  be used for identification purposes, but these purposes would be partly
  different from those officially claimed. There is, however, also the
  possibility that biometric systems are used to generate details which are not
  relevant to personal recognition, which is a proper case of function creep. To
  date, there is no evidence that any biometric application has ever been
  systematically used to reveal a subject’s personal details beyond those
  necessary for personal recognition. No one doubts that biometrics can be used
  to generate extra information, but until now, details that could be elicited
  by biometrics could also be obtained in easier ways. Consequently, there is no
  point in obtaining such information through the use of biometric applications.
  In practice, biometrics has the potential for being misused, but the
  cost/benefit ratio of such a misuse is still discouraging to any Big Brother
  candidate. Yet, this is likely to change in the near future with
  second-generation biometrics and large-scale adoption of multimodal systems.
  One of the possible variants of Murphy’s law states that if any technology can
  be misused, it will be, and there is no reason to assume that biometrics might
  escape this rule. Function creep is facilitated by a surplus of information.
  The principle of data minimization, or limitation, should then be the
  cornerstone of any biometric policy, which is respectful of privacy tenets.
  Unfortunately, this is not the case with most biometric systems, which are
  redundant and end up generating more data than necessary.</p>
<h4>Could Biometrics Become a “Liberating” Technology?</h4>
<p>The co-evolution between technologies and the body has various reasons but
  one deserves to be emphasized: all technologies regard the body because their
  ultimate scope is to enhance our “imperfect” nature, to alleviate the tyranny
  of human material constitution, its physical limitation, its space–temporal
  constraints and its limited capacity to perform actions. Technology is in its
  essence power. Biometrics promises to free human beings from at least two
  kinds of limitations.
<p>First, biometrics promises to free humans from centuries of identification
  systems based on physical marks, tokens, passwords, passes, visas and so. A
  recorded description of physical appearances (e.g. body size and shape, skin
  and hair colour, face shape, any physical deformity or particularity, wrinkles
  and scars) was probably the first way of recognizing someone else, and to be
  recognized. However, as the body gets older, faces change, voices can be
  altered, scares fade; brief descriptions of physical appearances alone
  probably became inadequate as human interactions became more and more frequent
  and complex. The first recognition schemes were probably based on artificial
  and more permanent body modifications (e.g. branding, tattooing,
  scarifications) and analogical identifiers. An analogical identifier is a
  token, a symbol, which could be either a physical object (e.g. a pass, a seal,
  a ring) or a mental content (e.g. a password, a memory, a poem) which may be
  linked with only an individual or a category of individuals. The term “symbol”
  means “to bring together” and originally the Greek word for “symbol” meant a
  plank, which was broken, in order for friends to recognize each other by mail.
  For example, if a messenger comes from a friend to ask for help, he was to
  bring the second part of the broken plank, and if it was matching the first
  part, then indeed it was a meeting with a friend. The first passports were
  issued in France by Luis XIV in 1669 and by the end of the 17th century
  passports and ID documents had become standard. Yet, only by the end of the
  19th century was a true passport system for controlling people’s movement
  between states universally established. Various ID documents, passes,
  safe-conducts, seals and other tokens remained the main instrument to
  ascertain people’s identity in everyday life until World War I. Finally, in
  late 1960s, Automatic Identification and Data Capture Technologies (AIDC)
  emerged as the first true innovation from the birth of photographic passports.
  It took some time, however, before people understood that biometrics had a
  very special status among other AIDCs. Biometrics could overcome – or at least
  have the potential for overcoming – all previous human recognition schemes.
  Biometrics does not imply any artificial modification of the body as tattoos
  do. Nor are biometric systems based on analogical representations (biometrics
  is not icons). A biometric system measures body parts, physiological and
  behavioural processes. Biometric systems generate digitalized representations
  of personal characteristics, say, digitalized tokens which link the individual
  observed here and now with reference data stored in a document, such as a
  travel document, or in a database. This is the real novelty of biometrics and
  what makes this technology revolutionary. For the first time in the history of
  the human species, human beings have really enhanced their capacity for
  recognizing other people by amplifying – through technical devices – their
  natural, physiological and recognition scheme, which is based on the
  appreciation of a complex web of physical and behavioural appearances.
  Biometric technology aims to solidify this scheme, which would naturally be
  fluctuating, liquid, unpredictable and even arbitrary.</p>
<p>Second, biometric technologies promise to liberate citizens from the
  “tyranny” of nation states and create new global, decentralized, rhyzomatic
  schemes for personal recognition. States keep in their hands the power to
  establish national identities, to fix genders, names, surnames, parental
  relationships and to assign rights and obligations to individual subjects
  according to the names written on their identity documents.
<p>The globalized world is confronted with a huge mass of people with weak or
  absent identities. Most developing countries have weak and unreliable
  documents and the poorest in these countries do not have even those unreliable
  documents. In 2000, UNICEF calculated that 50 million babies (41% of births
  worldwide) were not registered at birth and thus were without any
  identification document. Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal have not yet made
  child registration at birth mandatory. In this scenario a personal identity
  scheme based on citizenship and birth certificates is less and less tenable.
  The tourist who wants to use the same credit card in any part of the world,
  the asylum seeker who wants to access social benefits in the host country, the
  banker who moves in real time huge amounts of money from one stock market to
  another, they all have the same need. They must prove their identities, and
  they must be certain of others’ identities. But, they can no longer rely on
  traditional means for proving identities such as birth certificates, passports
  or ID cards, because these schemes are not dependable enough in most part of
  the world and unfit for global networks. By providing global networks with the
  means to establish trusted identities, the deployment of biometric
  applications is both a consequence and a building block of the new global
  wave. Moreover, biometric systems are the only large-scale identification
  systems that could be run also by small private actors and independent
  agencies instead of heavy governmental structures. This presents the
  possibility to create a global system for personal recognition, which would be
  closer to the Internet than to the Leviathan. Certainly, any process of
  personal identification implies that individuals are recognized subjects of
  rights and obligations, and this could be seen as a limitation of individual
  liberty. Yet, there would be no right, no liberty, without personal
  identities. One can claim her rights, including the right to be left alone,
  and the right to refuse to be identified, only if she is an identifiable
  subject, if she has a public identity. Even if one is identified only for
  being unjustly arrested, this still means that there are some rules. Personal
  recognition always implies a certain respect for the law (of course a law can
  be horrible, but this is a different issue) because it implicitly affirms the
  principle of personal responsibility. Erasing individual identity and
  substituting it with a group identity has always been an important instrument
  for dehumanizing people. People recognition implies two separate concepts,
  namely that an individual belongs to categories and that she is distinguished
  by other persons and understood as one. In other words, there are two
  different aspects involved in people recognition: (1) distinguishing between
  individuals and (2) distinguishing between sets of people. The latter is
  likely to be the real issue. Dictatorships of any kind and totalitarian
  regimes have always ruled by categorizing people and by creating different
  classes of subjects. There are at least two causes for this: (1) from a
  psychological point of view, it is easier to induce cruelty against groups
  that are somehow abstract entities, rather than against single, identified,
  individuals, and (2) from a social and political point of view this allows for
  a process known as “pseudospeciation”. Pseudospeciation is a process which
  turns social and cultural differences into biological diversities. It promotes
  cooperation within social groups, overpowering the selfish interests of
  individuals in favour of collective interests, yet inhibits cooperation
  between groups, and it fosters conflict and mistrust.</p>
<p>Raids, concentration camps, mass deportations and executions, which have
  caused the most horrible manslaughters, are all acts based on
  pseudospeciation, which requires that people are sorted out according to some
  shared attributes (e.g. skin colour, cultural or religious belonging,
  nationality, physical disabilities, social class, location) and that their
  individual identities are cancelled.
<h4>Final Considerations</h4>
<p>This leads us to a final consideration, rather than a true conclusion.
  General public and privacy advocates are often worried that large-scale
  biometric systems can turn democratic states into states of police. It is
  certainly true that biometric applications can be misused and I have
  illustrated why; biometric systems tend unavoidably to collect extra details
  that are at permanent risk to facilitate or even encourage function creep.
  Yet, until biometric applications are used for specific individual recognition
  they are rather safe. Personal recognition per se does not threaten basic
  liberties or infringe upon the private sphere. Individual recognition has very
  rarely been used in mass surveillance because – apart from any other
  consideration – it would be too expensive and ineffective. Of course, one can
  be legitimately worried by giving too much power to governments, but this is
  not the most troublesome issue, particularly since biometric technologies are
  global technologies which promise, in the mid-term, to weaken rather than to
  strengthen nation state authority. On the contrary, personal recognition may
  empower people, not only because it offers a ground for entitlements, but also
  because identity is what establishes and protects fundamental human
  rights.</p>
<p>Yet biometrics, in particular second-generation biometrics and soft
  biometrics, has also the potentiality to be powerful instrument for people
  categorization and this is its “dark side“, what could make biometrics
  ethically and politically worrisome. There is then a certain irony in the fact
  that enthusiasms and concerns surrounding biometrics are both justified, but
  they are probably both misplaced.</p>
