<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>I am a hardworking, highly motivated 1st year Computing student at Imperial College London who loves to learn new things. Throughout my academic life I have always been a huge advocate for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) subjects, as I do not think there is anything more important, interesting or exciting than learning about how the world around us works and how we can design and implement new technologies and ideas.</p>
<h4>CyberFirst</h4>
<p>I am sponsored by the <a target='_blank' href='https://www.cyberfirst.ncsc.gov.uk'>CyberFirst</a> bursary scheme which is a government and industry backed initiative that was launched in 2015 with the aim of closing the UK skills gap in cybersecurity.
  The scheme is not just aimed at A level students looking to study STEM at university, but also looks to involve younger students through summer camps and activity days, as well as through apprenticeship schemes, to try and motivate skilled students to follow a career in computing and cybersecurity.
  Through the scheme, I am due to complete an 8 week placement in the cybersecurity sector with a relevant organisation this summer.</p>
<h4>Education</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Imperial College London.</b> Studying for a BEng in Computing, graduating in 2020.</li>
  <li><b>Freman College, Buntingford.</b> 11 GCSEs at A<sup>*</sup> and A grades. 4 A levels in Maths, Further Maths, Physics and Chemistry at grades A<sup>*</sup> and A, A, A grades respectively. Achieved 100% in D1 and C2 maths modules and 90% upwards in 6 other modules. Also achieved an A grade in an EPQ based around cybersecurity.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Work Experience</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Hewlett Packard Enterprise.</b> Shadowed the mission critical engineering team tasked with managing and maintaining the company's top-level UK clients' IT systems.</li>
  <li><b>Student Camp Leader.</b> One of 3 leaders tasked with planning and coordinating an interesting and educational 5 day trip to London for 40+ foreign students. Also participated in other similar camps acting as a workshop leader for talks and workshops on British life, society and education.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Interests in Computing</h4>
<p>Particular topics within computing that interest me include cybersecurity and cryptography. I have read extensively into the history of cryptography, and how new mathematical techniques for cryptanalysis led to new, more complex ciphers being developed that themselves relied on new mathematical ideas such as one way functions. Through my reading I found particular interest in how older algorithms such as the Diffie-Hellman key exchange procedure for exchanging cryptographic public keys were applied to modern issues such as secure communication over the internet, through IP protocols such as SSL and TLS.</p>
<p>During my 2 years of sixth form, I undertook an EPQ on the subject of state surveillance and cybersecurity centred around the story of Edward Snowden, who released classified information about the NSA and its partner organisations in 2013. In recent months I have read into cybersecurity issues such as stuxnet, the malicious computer worm that targeted Iranian nuclear centrifuges, as well as more global issues such as the often poor security of internet of things connected devices.</p>
<h3>Interests outside Computing</h3>
<p>Outside of computing, one of my biggest interests is aviation. In the past couple of years I have taken occasional flying lessons, with the hope of one day earning my private pilots license (PPL) which has been a lifelong ambition of mine. I think that my love for STEM can be attributed to my passion for aviation from an early age. I am also a keen movie goer, and a big fan of the game of golf. I started having lessons when I was 6 years old and although I do not play regularly I enjoy watching the game and attending tournaments as a social event.</p>
