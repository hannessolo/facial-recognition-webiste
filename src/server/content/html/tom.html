<h4>About Me</h4>
<p>I am a hardworking, highly motivated student at Imperial College London who loves to learn new things. Throughout my academic life I have always been a huge advocate for STEM subjects, as I do not think there is anything more important (or more interesting!) than learning about how the world around us works and how we can design and implement new technologies and ideas.</p>
<p>I am sponsored by the <a target='_blank' href='https://www.cyberfirst.ncsc.gov.uk'>CyberFirst</a> bursary scheme which is a government and industry backed initiative that was launched in 2015 with the aim of closing the UK skills gap in cyber security. 
  The scheme is not just aimed at A level students looking to study STEM at university, but also looks to involve younger students through summer camps and activity days, to try and motivate skilled students to follow a career in computing (and more specifically, in cybersecurity). 
  Before I had even been accepted on to the program, I was already a huge supporter of promoting the importance of science, technology, engineering and maths as I personally feel that there is not enough of focus on STEM in the UK education system, and this is especially true for computing. 
  My school did not offer Computer Science as an A level, so all of my reading and learning on the subject had to be done in my spare time. For this reason I think that schemes such as CyberFirst are incredibly important so that more students have the oppurtunity to consider (and hopefully choose) computing and cybersecurity as a career path. Through the scheme, I am due to complete an 8 week placement in cybersecurity with a relevant organisation or department this summer, which should be an interesting and exciting oppurtunity to witness how cybersecurity issues are tackled in the real world. </p>
<h3>Interests in Computing</h3>
<p>Particular topics within computing that interest me include cybersecurity and cryptography. I have read extensively into the history of cryptography, and how new mathematical techniques for cryptanalysis led to new, more complex ciphers being developed that themselves relied on new mathematical ideas such as one way functions. Through my reading I found particular interest in how older algorithms such as the Diffie-Hellman key exchange procedure for exchanging cryptographic public keys were applied to modern issues such as secure communication over the internet, through IP protocols such as SSL and TLS.</p>
<p>During my 2 years of sixth form, I undertook an EPQ on the subject of state surveillance and cybersecurity centred around the story of Edward Snowden, who released classified information about the NSA and its partner organisations in 2013. In recent months Iâ€™ve read into cybersecurity issues such as stuxnet, the malicious computer worm that targeted Iranian nuclear centrifuges, as well as more global issues such as the often poor security of internet of things connected devices.  One such example is that of 1,000s of CCTV cameras being hacked to form a botnet, providing the capability to carry out large scale DDoS attacks.</p>
<h3>Interests outside Computing</h3>
<p>Outside of computing, one of my biggest interests has always been aviation. In the past couple of years I have taken occasional flying lessons, which are hopefully the first steps towards one day earning my private pilots license (PPL). My parents often remind me that since the age of 3 I have been able to point out different aircraft types and airlines. Ultimately I think my love of aviation and flying, and my passion for the STEM subjects fed off of each other, and without one I probably would not have as keen of an interest in the other.</p>
<p>I am also a keen movie goer, and a big fan of the game of golf. I started having lessons when I was 6 years old and although I do not play much anymore I enjoy watching the game and attending golf tournaments from time to time.</p>
