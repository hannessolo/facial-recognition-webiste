<h3>Applications of Facial Recognition</h3>
<h4>Facial Recognition vs Other Biometric Traits</h4>
<p>The standout feature of facial recognition as a means of biometric identification that sets it apart from other biometric traits is that it does not require physical contact with the user, or even require their cooperation. For example, using fingerprints as a means for biometric recognition requires physical contact with the user, which in turn also requires their cooperation and knowledge of what is taking place. Iris scanning causes a similar scenario, because although physical contact is not required, a close up high definition image of the person's iris is required which is only possible with current technology when the user is incredibly close to the camera, hence this system also requires the user's cooperation. This is what sets facial recognition apart as a biometric trait: although in many applications a user will be cooperative and facial recognition systems can make use of this, they do not need to, and many systems operate at a distance and do not require user cooperation. It is this feature that leads to many of the core applications of facial recognition such as watch-list surveillance, which we will discuss shortly.</p>
<h4>Verification</h4>
<p>Verification, also known as authentication is one potential mode of operation for a facial recognition system. Verification system operate in a one-to-one capacity in that the face being analysed is compared against the claimant's face images already stored in the database to verify that the faces, and hence the identities, match. A good example of this is at boarder controls with e-passport gates. The user presents their passport which allows the system to look up the claimed identity in a database. Then, the system tries to verify that the live image of the person at the gate matches the stored facial images in the database, and if they do then access is granted.</p>
<h4>Identification</h4>
<p>On the other hand lies the identification mode. Identification is one-to-many in that the user (or person being queried) does not claim any identity. The face in question is compared to all the faces already stored in the database to determine which identity (if many) matches the queried face. A good example of this is watch-list surveillance/criminal identification, which operate in a many-to-one capacity to find matches in the database that it is confident match the identity of the person being queried.</p>
