<h4>Different ways to facial recognition</h4>
<p>
  In practice, there are different methods for facial recognition. Historically,
  like PCA or feature extraction. However, in recent years (since around 2011),
  CNNs have started dominating
  the field, as they are much more accurate than previously used methods. CNNs have
  only become viable in recent years because of a massive increase in (1) computing
  power and, more importantly, (2) the amount of data available. This
  is becuase of how we have started to use the internet to generate and store
  masses of data.

  This digit recognition app uses a CNN trained in tensorflow with the MNIST
  dataset of handwritten digits. The source code can be viewed
