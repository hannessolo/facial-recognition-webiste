<h3>Applications of Facial Recognition</h3>
<h4>Facial Recognition vs Other Biometric Traits</h4>
<p>The standout feature of facial recognition as a means of biometric identification that sets it apart from other biometric traits is that it does not require physical contact with the user, or even require their cooperation. For example, using fingerprints as a means for biometric recognition requires physical contact with the user, which in turn also requires their cooperation and knowledge of what is taking place. Iris scanning causes a similar scenario, because although physical contact is not required, a close up high definition image of the person's iris is required which is only possible with current technology when the user is incredibly close to the camera, hence this system also requires the user's cooperation. This is what sets facial recognition apart as a biometric trait: although in many applications a user will be cooperative and facial recognition systems can make use of this, they do not need to, and many systems operate at a distance and do not require user cooperation. It is this feature that leads to many of the core applications of facial recognition such as watch-list surveillance, which we will discuss shortly.</p>
<h4>Verification</h4>
<p>Verification, also known as authentication is one potential mode of operation for a facial recognition system. Verification system operate in a one-to-one capacity in that the face being analysed is compared against the claimant's face images already stored in the database to verify that the faces, and hence the identities, match. A good example of this is at boarder controls with e-passport gates. The user presents their passport which allows the system to look up the claimed identity in a database. Then, the system tries to verify that the live image of the person at the gate matches the stored facial images in the database, and if they do then access is granted.</p>
<h4>Identification</h4>
<p>On the other hand lies the identification mode. Identification is one-to-many in that the user (or person being queried) does not claim any identity. The face in question is compared to all the faces already stored in the database to determine which identity (if many) matches the queried face. A good example of this is watch-list surveillance/criminal identification, which operate in a many-to-one capacity to find matches in the database that it is confident match the identity of the person being queried.</p>
<h4>Examples of Application Scenarios</h4>
<p>Access control is a very common application of user cooperative facial recognition systems. The systems can operate in either identification or verification modes, however one-to-one scenarios tend to be more common where the user presents an ID card with a claimed identity that the system then attempts to verify. This scenario can be extended to include systems such as those used for biometric border control systems, that combine E-passports as a form of ID card with a biometric verification system such as facial recognition. These systems tend to 3D facial depth map algorithms rather than standard 2D algorithms, as these tend to offer higher levels of security for sensitve issues such as border control.</p>

<p>Most methods for facial recogniton up until quite recently have used images captured by traditional cameras that capture visible light. For example a CCD or CMOS sensor is used to capture a colour or black and white face image. As detailed in the challenges section, the main issue that these systems face is that of poor lighting and <a href='illumination.html'>illumination</a> conditions. There are several approaches to trying to solve the problem of poor illumination, ranging from research into algorithms that are stable under poor lighting to moving to 3D depth based algorithms. An alternative solution is to use near infrared imaging (NIR). The advantage or NIR face recognition systems is that the use of infrared light allows for even frontal lighting on the face and it also minimises the effect of light from other sources. The predictable, even lighting conditions also simplify the algorithms and analysis needed to perform the recognition task. NIR systems are fairly modern, but have already been applied successfully to access control scenarios and for biometric immmigration control at the Shenzhen-Hong Kong border.</p>
