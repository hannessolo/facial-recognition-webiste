<h3>2D vs 3D Facial Recognition</h3>
<h4>Introduction to 3D Facial Recognition</h4>
<p>In recent years, there has been a huge increase in the performance (speed and accuracy) of facial recognition algorithms, and this can mainly be attributed to research leading to new advancements in 3D facial recognition techniques. This is because 3D methods make use of both the shape and texture of a persons face, and so have access to more information than standard 2D approaches that rely solely on face texture from 2D images. This gives 3D facial recognition as a modality the possibilty of achieving far greater accuracy than 2D methods.</p>
<p>By using data from both the shape of a persons face and the texture of the surface simultaneously, 3D methods can start to overcome the shortcomings that are inevitable and hard to control with standard 2D methods: such issues are changes in lighting/illumination, the orientation of the head in relation to the camera and facial expressions. Having access to information of the shape of the face allows us to start removing some of the negative effects of illumination of pose from the texture data.</p>
<p>Texture data links to the intensity of the light being reflected off of the surface of the face. Research has shown that the shape and structure of a persons face provides significant information about identity on its own. Therefore by combining the 2 channels, we have the ability to improve the accuracy of the texture data by using the shape data to remove the effects of pose and illumination, as well as having access to more information to analyse about a persons identity. It is therefore clear that a system that combines both 2D and 3D methods gives us the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>Although 3D methods do not suffer from the same downfalls as 2D methods, they do have some factors that affect them. While external factors like illumination and pose do not directly inhibit a 3D method, they do make analysing the face more time-consuming: a 3D method will still work optimally when provided with a clear frontal image in good light. Other factors that affect 3D methods more significantly than 2D are internal, such as that faces are highly deformable and can change shape and appearance during speech and facial expressions. For a 2D method, movement of the face during capture could lead to motion blur and reduce the quality of the image, however as 3D methods capture information on the physical shape of the face, a facial movement during capture of a 3D scan could lead to the wrong identification of the individual. Active research is still being done into how automated 3D facial recognition systems can tackle these internal factors and provide more accurate scans when these factors are taken into account.</p>
<h4>Acquisition technology</h4>
<p>Many different 3D acquisition technologies exist at varying costs and with a variety of operating characteristics. Below we briefly discuss a few examples.</p>
<p>The most cost effective method for implementing 3D facial recognition is to use multiple standard 2D cameras to acquire several images of the target face simultaneously from different angles, and to then use these images to reconstruct a 3D surface model of the face. This implementation is known as stereo acquisition, although the system does not need to contain just 2 cameras: it can contain several to capture several different viewpoints of the face. Stereo acquisition is fast and flexible as the distance between the face and the cameras can be adjusted as required, however good lighting conditions are required as standard 2D cameras are used.</p>
<p>Another method that can be used alongside stereo acquisition is to project a structured light pattern onto the face while the images are being taken. This can be used with multiple cameras to improve the speed and effciency of the reconstruction, or the structured light pattern allows 3D face capture to be done with a single camera. This is because the projected light pattern allows the system to work out how to reconstruct multiple pictures without the need for a stereo image. The downside of this method is that the light pattern makes it sensitive to external lighting conditions. Also, the use of visible light for the projected light pattern can cause interference with the colour images needed to record texture information, and for this reason near-infrared light (NIR) is often used for the projected light structure.</p>
<p>One final method we will discuss is active scanning. This uses a laser beam that reflects off the surface of the face, thus indicating the distance between the emitter and the face and producing a range image. Combining the range image from the lasers, and high-resolution images from a standard camera can lead to a highly accurate face recognition system, although active scanning systems are normally slower than stereo acquisition or projected light systems. This is quite a significant flaw, as the effects of motion blur are amplified in 3D capture compared to 2D capture.</p>
<h4>Application Scenarios for 3D Systems</h4>
<p>Due to the technology required to implement 3D facial recognition systems, they are usuallly only used in scenarios where high levels of security and accuracy are required. We now list some of the key applications of 3D facial recognition systems.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Border Control</b> is a primary example. Airport security and border control demands the highest levels of security and accuracy possible, so it is clear why this is a situation that 3D systems would excel in. The usual procedure for recognition involves the individual stopping in front of the scanner at the border control point, where the full face scanner can capture between 5000 and 100000 3D points depending on the system in use. These points are then used to create a biometric template. In this scenario the secure storage of the templates must be considered. Border control systems often operate in verification mode as the individual presents their passport as a means of identification: E-passports can now be used to store the biometric template, which is one solution to the secure storage issue.</li>
  <li><b>Access Control</b> is another typical and somewhat obvious example. Companies often want to maintain high levels of security as to who can enter their office buildings. Again, these systems normally operate in verification scenarios as employees can be given an RFID identifcation card which can be used to store the biometric template.</li>
  <li><b>Criminal Identification</b> is the final scenario we will discuss. Registered criminals will have a scan of their face acquired and stored in a database. Then, an image of a suspect can be taken from CCTV footage for example, and the face searched for in the database of known criminals. It is scenarios such as these that would benefit the most from research in 3D facial recognition. For example, if we could find a reliable, accurate method for converting 2D images to 3D models then the database of known images can be enhanced with 3D models. This would allow more accurate identification in a wider range of scenarios, as the images of faces that can be taken from CCTV footage are often far from optimal, due to the quality of the image or the orientation of the individual in the image.</li>
</ul>
